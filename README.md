# DA3-Python-Codes

Coding classes in Python for Data Analysis 3 on MSc in Business Analytics on the Central European University.

The notebooks are slightly modified versions of the [case studies](https://github.com/gabors-data-analysis/da_case_studies) for the [Bekes - Kezdi Data Analysis textbook](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/).

The code has been developed and tested on Python 3.10.
